# Depression Detection and Support System Using Machine Learning

## Project Objectives
- Measure the likelihood of individuals struggling with depression symptoms.
- Categorize depression severity as mild or severe.
- Provide activities and strategies to help individuals overcome depression.

## Methodology
1. Obtain the dataset for training and testing.
2. Train the models using SVM Regression, SVM Classification, Decision Trees, Naive Bayes classifier, KNN classifier, and Random Forest classifier.
3. Evaluate the models using performance metrics and choose the best model.
4. Implement the chosen model for depression detection and severity assessment.

## Background Theory
- Support Vector Machines (SVM) Regression and Classification: Utilized for accurate prediction and classification of depression symptoms.
- Decision Trees: Used to construct a hierarchical model for decision-making based on input features.
- Naive Bayes Classifier: A probabilistic classifier for determining the likelihood of depression based on input variables.
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classifier: Determines depression severity based on the proximity to other instances.
- Random Forest Classifier: An ensemble learning method combining multiple decision trees for robust depression detection.

## Project Description
The Depression Detection and Support System is a machine learning-based project developed to identify and provide support for individuals experiencing depression symptoms. This system offers an accurate assessment of the likelihood and severity of depression, enabling early intervention and appropriate support.

By leveraging advanced statistical and probabilistic techniques, the system analyzes relevant datasets and employs a variety of machine learning algorithms to predict depression symptoms and classify their severity. This allows individuals to gain insights into their mental health status in a discreet and judgment-free environment.

Moreover, the system offers a range of activities and strategies designed to assist individuals in overcoming depression. These activities are carefully curated to address various aspects of mental well-being and empower users to engage in daily activities effectively.
